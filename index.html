            <p id="tres">
                I was born in Central America, <a class="four" href="https://www.lonelyplanet.com/nicaragua/granada-and-the-masaya-region/granada">
                <span class="five">Granada, Nicaragua</span></a>. I came to the United States when I was 12 years old. I remember that during that 
                month of December, the weather was very cold. I lived in the Bronx for most of my life, but I also lived in other boroughs and other states.
                <br>
                <br>
                I always had a passion for Illustration. During my teen years, I used illustration as a way to express my thoughts and ideas. 
                I never had the opportunity of having someone to teach me new techniques as I tried to enhance my drawing skills. I looked at other peoples work 
                like paintings, sketches, cartoons and comic book drawings to study their styles. Some of these great artists are <a class="four" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Ross">
                <span class="five">Alex Ross</span></a>, <a class="four" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Frazetta"><span class="five">Frank Frazetta</span></a>, 
                <a class="four" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Lee"><span class="five">Jim Lee</span></a> and <a class="four" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Miller_(comics)">
                <span class="five">Frank Miller</span></a>. At age of 33, I attended <a class="four" href="http://www.fitnyc.edu/"><span class="five">FIT University of New York City</span>,</a> 
                I was able to study Graphic Design, Illustration and Photography.
                <br>
                <br>
                At times, the language has been a barrier for me, this barrier hasn't stop me from learning. I was able to complete my seculiar education on time and learned new things. 
                This has helped me to improve as a person and reach my goals. Web Developing is a new goal that I have and I want to excel in this new career. I want to use my creativity 
                as I build attractive websites and make all of my clients very happy with the work I have done for them.
