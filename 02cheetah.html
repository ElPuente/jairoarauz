                <p>The cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) is a big cat in the subfamily Felinae that inhabits<br> most of Africa and parts of Iran. It is the only extant member of the genus<br> Acinonyx. The cheetah can run as fast as 109.4 to 120.7 km/h (68.0 to 75.0<br> mph), faster than any other land animal. It covers distances up to 500 m (1,640<br> ft) in short bursts, and can accelerate from 0 to 96 km/h (0 to 60 mph) in three<br> seconds. The cheetah's closest extant relatives are the puma and jaguarundi of<br> the Americas. Cheetahs are notable for adaptations in the paws as they are one<br> of the few felids with only semi-retractable claws.<br>

                <br>
                Their main hunting strategy is to trip swift prey such as various antelope species<br> and hares with its dewclaw. Almost every facet of the cheetah's anatomy has<br> evolved to maximise its success in the chase, the result of an evolutionary arms<br> race with its prey. Due to this specialisation, however, the cheetah is poorly<br> equipped to defend itself against other large predators, with speed being its main<br> means of defence. In the wild, the cheetah is a prolific breeder, with up to nine<br> cubs in a litter. The majority of cubs do not survive to adulthood, mainly as a<br> result of depredation from other predators. The rate of cub mortality varies from<br> area to area, from 50% to 75%, and in extreme cases such as the Serengeti<br> ecosystem, up to 90%. Cheetahs are notoriously poor breeders in captivity,<br> though several organizations, such as the De Wildt Cheetah and Wildlife Centre,<br> have succeeded in breeding high numbers of cubs.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                The cheetah is listed as vulnerable, facing various threats including loss of habitat<br> and prey; conflict with humans; the illegal pet trade; competition with and<br> predation by other carnivores; and a gene pool with very low variability. It is a<br> charismatic species and many captive cats are "ambassadors" for their species<br> and wildlife conservation in general.</p>

                <p>Cheetahs inhabit dry and open areas, such as clayey deserts, steppes,<br> savannahs and grasslands, acacia scrubs and light woodland. Most cheetahs<br> never enter dense forests or thickets except Asiatic cheetahs that lived in dense<br> forested regions in India. In Africa, cheetahs once occurred in these types of<br> habitat from the Mediterranean to the Cape Peninsula, and in Asia from the<br> northern Arabian Peninsula eastwards to the Deccan Plateau and West Bengal<br> in India. Until the first half of the 20th century, cheetahs were killed by sport<br>
                hunters and became scarce throughout their range. In South Africa they were<br> hunted to almost extermination by the 1930s. In Arabia, there have not been any<br> reliable records since the 1950s. The Qattara Depression in Egypt was<br> considered their last refuge by the 1960s. In India, they were declared extinct in<br> 1952.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                Since the 1950s, cheetahs were eradicated in at least 13 countries by farmers<br> and trophy hunters. Between 1978 and 1994, more than 9,500 cheetahs were<br> killed on Namibian farmlands alone. Today, cheetah populations are small and<br> isolated, with viable populations in about half of the countries where cheetahs<br> survive. Their remaining strongholds are in Kenya, Tanzania, Botswana and<br> Namibia. The remaining population of Asiatic cheetahs survives in fragmented<br> protected areas around the Dasht-e-Kavir in eastern Iran. In 2008, this<br> population was considered very small, comprising less than 50 reproducing<br> individuals.</p>
